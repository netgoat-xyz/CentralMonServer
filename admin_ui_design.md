# Admin UI Design for CentralMonServer

## Dashboard Layout

### Sections:
1. **Server Status**:
   - Display whether the server is online or offline.
   - Show a timestamp of the last status check.

2. **Response Times**:
   - Display the average response time for the server.
   - Show a graph of response times over time.

3. **History**:
   - List of server statuses (online/offline) with timestamps.
   - Include response times for each status entry.

## Data Integration

### Backend Endpoints:
1. **GET /status**:
   - Fetch the current server status (online/offline).
   - Include the timestamp of the last check.

2. **GET /response-times**:
   - Fetch the average response time.
   - Include historical response times for graphing.

3. **GET /history**:
   - Fetch the history of server statuses and response times.

## Frontend Framework
- Use React for the UI.
- Utilize existing React-based setup in the `reactbased` folder.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (already present in the workspace).

## Next Steps
1. Implement the backend endpoints in `CentralMonServer`.
2. Develop the React components for the admin UI.
3. Integrate the frontend with the backend endpoints.
